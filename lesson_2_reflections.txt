Q.1 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A.1 on initialising t a repo git creates a .git file which will act as a local repository for the user to make changes,erform commits on. Initially it has 0 commits and does not include any file in the repository. one has to use git add <file name> to take that particular file to staging area and then perform git commit to make sure snapshot is saved in the repository.
